    <h1 class="text-2xl">Discuss the scope of var, let, and const!</h1>
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 ml-5">
        <li>Var
            <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
                <li>Function Scope: Variables declared with var have function scope, meaning they are accessible within
                    the function in which they are defined. They are not block-scoped.</li>
                <li>Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global
                    scope. However, only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization. This can lead to unexpected
                    behavior if you try to access the variable before it's declared.</li>
                <li>Re-declaration: You can re-declare a variable using var within the same scope without any error.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Const
            <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
                <li>Block Scope: Variables declared with const also have block scope, similar to let.</li>
                <li>Hoisting: Variables declared with const are hoisted to the top of their block but are also in the
                    temporal dead zone until they are initialized.</li>
                <li>No Re-declaration: You cannot re-declare a variable using const within the same scope. Additionally,
                    variables declared with const are constant, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are
                    assigned.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Let
            <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
                <li>Block Scope: Variables declared with let have block scope, meaning they are accessible only within
                    the block (enclosed by curly braces) where they are defined, including loops, if statements, and
                    functions.</li>
                <li>Hoisting: Variables declared with let are hoisted to the top of their block, but they are in the
                    "temporal dead zone" (TDZ) until they are initialized. This means you cannot access the variable
                    before its declaration.</li>
                <li>No Re-declaration: You cannot re-declare a variable using let within the same scope.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h1 class="text-2xl mt-8">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1>

    <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 ml-5">
        <li>null
            <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
                <li>Explicitly assigned: Developers can set a variable or object property to null to indicate that it
                    intentionally has no value or no reference to an object.</li>
                <li>Initialization: You can initialize a variable with null to prepare it for a value assignment in the
                    future.</li>
                <li>Comparison: null can be used for comparisons to check if a variable or object property has been
                    explicitly set to "nothing" or "no value."
                </li>
                <li>Commonly used in APIs: Some APIs return null to indicate that a requested resource or value doesn't
                    exist.</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>undefined
            <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
                <li>Default value: Variables that have been declared but haven't been assigned a value are automatically
                    set to undefined. This is the default value.</li>
                <li>Function parameters: When a function is called with fewer arguments than the number of parameters it
                    expects, the missing parameters are undefined.</li>
                <li>Properties that don't exist: When you try to access an object property that doesn't exist, you'll
                    get undefined.</li>
                <li>Array elements that don't exist: Accessing an array element at an index that doesn't exist will
                    return undefined.</li>
                <li>Return value: If a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it returns undefined</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ol>

    <h1 class="text-2xl mt-8">What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
    <p class="ml-5">
        A REST API, or Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and
        conventions for building and interacting with web services. It is an architectural style for designing networked
        applications and is one of the most common approaches for creating APIs on the internet. Here are some key
        aspects of REST APIs:
